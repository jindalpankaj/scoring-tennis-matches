Log My Tennis!
---

This is a minimalistic webapp to score Tennis matches. It allows for 3 or 5 sets, and 7 or 12 point tiebreakers. This allows for scoring almost all formats of professional Tennis matches.

This webapp is made using the following technologies:
- Backend: Python Flask framework
- Frontend: Bootstrap framework, JavaScript (JQuery framework) 

This app is deployed on Heroku and is available here: https://tennis-scoring.herokuapp.com/

Future work:
1. Connect with a database and allow for user-logins and permanently saving match scores.
2. Connect it with the point prediction project (https://github.com/jindalpankaj/points-prediction-tennis) and allow for real-time prediction of individual points.
